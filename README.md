# Aadhaar Masker ‚Äî YOLOv8 + Tesseract + FastAPI

**Aadhaar Masker** is a FastAPI-based service that detects Aadhaar numbers in images using a **pre-trained YOLOv8 Aadhaar number detection model** and Tesseract OCR, then securely blurs and masks them (keeping only the last 4 digits). It includes REST endpoints for direct image masking and debugging, designed for quick deployment from a Colab notebook.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Privacy & Legal Note:** Aadhaar numbers are highly sensitive personal data. Use this tool only with authorized data and do not expose real Aadhaar images or tokens in public repositories.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Pre-trained YOLOv8 model** specifically for detecting Aadhaar number regions in images.
- Tesseract OCR to extract digits and decide which number to mask.
- Strong blur inside detected regions with masked overlay (e.g. `XXXX XXXX 1234`).
- FastAPI endpoints:
  - `POST /predict` ‚Üí returns masked PNG image.
  - `POST /predict_debug` ‚Üí returns detections, OCR text, and base64 masked image for debugging.
- Works directly from a Colab notebook or can be run locally.
