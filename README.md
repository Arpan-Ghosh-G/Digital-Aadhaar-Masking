# Digital-Aadhaar-Masking
Aadhaar Masker â€” A FastAPI-based service that detects Aadhaar numbers in images using YOLOv8 and Tesseract OCR, then securely blurs and masks them (keeping only the last 4 digits). Includes REST endpoints for direct image masking and debugging, designed for quick deployment from a Colab notebook.
